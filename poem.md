<body>
<p>In visions of the dark night
I have <em>dreamed</em> of joy departed
But a waking <strong>dream</strong> of life and light
Hath left me broken-hearted.</p>

<p>Ah! what is not a <strong>dream</strong> by day
To him whose eyes are cast
On things around him with a ray
Turned back upon the past?</p>

<p>That holy <strong>dream</strong> that holy dream,
While all the world were chiding,
Hath cheered me as a lovely beam,
A lonely spirit guiding.</p>

<p>What though that light, thro' storm and night,
So trembled from afar
What could there be more purely bright
In Truth's day star?<br><br>http://www.public-domain-poetry.com/edgar-allan-poe/dream-1752</p>
